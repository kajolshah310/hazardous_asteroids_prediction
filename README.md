# Hazardous Asteroids Prediction

## Description
This repository focuses on predicting whether asteroids are potentially hazardous or not using machine learning algorithms. The objective of this project is to develop a model that can classify asteroids based on their potential threat to Earth.

Asteroids pose a potential risk to our planet, and it is essential to accurately assess their hazardous nature to enable proactive measures for planetary defense. By leveraging machine learning algorithms, we can analyze various features and characteristics of asteroids to predict their hazard level.

## Motivation
I have a keen interest in the field of Astrophysics, and when I came across this interesting problem statement, I decided to work on it. The goal was to create a model using machine learning algorithms in R to predict whether asteroids are potentially hazardous or not.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the Asteroid Dataset, which is officially maintained by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory of the California Institute of Technology, an organization under NASA. The dataset contains a large number of rows and features, and it also has missing values.

To handle the missing values, two approaches were followed:
1. Replacing the missing values with the mean of the respective column.
2. Removing the rows with missing values.

Please note that the dataset used for training and evaluation is crucial for the accuracy and reliability of the model. It is important to ensure the quality and reliability of the dataset, as well as employing appropriate preprocessing techniques to enhance the performance of the model.

## Approach
The project involves the following steps:
1. Data preprocessing, including handling missing values and feature selection.
2. Implementation of machine learning algorithms in R, such as decision trees, random forests, or support vector machines, for predicting the hazard level of asteroids.
3. Model evaluation using appropriate performance metrics to assess the accuracy and reliability of the predictions.

## Usage
1) Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
```
git clone https://github.com/kajolshah310/hazardous_asteroids_prediction.git
```

2) Open the asteroids_pred_approach_2.Rmd file in RStudio or any other compatible IDE.

3) Install the required packages and dependencies mentioned in the file, if necessary.

4) Execute the code and follow along with the implementation of the hazardous asteroids prediction model.

Feel free to modify the code, experiment with different algorithms, or explore additional techniques to improve the accuracy of the predictions.
